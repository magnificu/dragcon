I have the following code in git (https://github.com/magnificu/dragcon.git) that creates, edit and delete "items" in an sqlite db.
I want to extend this code as follows:

Project
|-WP1
| |-subWP1.1
| | |-item1.1.1
| | |-item1.1.2
| | |-item1.1.3
| |
| |-subWP1.2
| | |-item1.2.1
| |
|-WP2
| |-subWP2.1
| | |-item2.1.1
| |
| |-subWP2.2
| | |-item2.2.1
| | |-item2.2.2


Database update:
Give me the query to create the database including some dummy data


1. new "tb_Project" table that will contain the name of the new dragable window
2. new relational "rel_Project_WP" table that must save the relation id_Project and id_WP
3. When the WP is drop in the Project window box area, a database link needs to be established
4. new "tb_WP" table that will contain the name of the new dragable window
5. new relational "rel_WP_subWP" table that must save the relation id_WP and id_subWP
6. When the subWP is drop in the WP window box area, a database link needs to be established
7. new "tb_subWP" table that will contain the name of the new dragable window
8. new relational "rel_subWP_item" table that must save the relation id_subWP and id_item
9. When the items are drop in the subWP window box area, a database link needs to be established


User Interface update

1. "Project" dragable window that have inside a gray box area (<div>) where the user can drag and drop "WP" window.
2. Multiple links of the same "WP" should be allowed and must be shown individualy in the "Project" window box area.
3. The box area should highlight when the "WP" hovers above.
4. "WP" dragable window that have inside a gray box area where I want to drag and drop the "subWP" window.
5. Multiple links of the same "subWP" should be allowed and must be shown individualy in the "WP" window box area.
6. The box area should highlight when the "subWP" hovers above.
7. "subWP" dragable window that have inside a gray box area (<div>) where the user can drag and drop "items" from the items dragable window.
8. Multiple links of the same item should be allowed and must be shown individualy in the "subWP" window box area.
9. The box area should highlight when the "item" hovers above.
10. The items window to create, edit and delete "items" exists already. This can be updated if requred to implement the above.

Other drag and drop links should not be allowed (e.g. item to Project or item to WP, etc.)

Give me the udpated code
